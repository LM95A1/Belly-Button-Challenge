# JavaScript Visualization Challenge: Belly Button Biodiversity

*JavaScript Visualization Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 14*

## Background
*In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.*

*The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.*

## Assignment Components
This repository consists of two main components:

* **Interactive Page (`index.html`):**
This HTML file serves as the interactive page containing the visualizations and data analysis. It utilizes *Bootstrap* and *D3* to create the page layout and interactive elements. The page is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://lm95a1.github.io/Belly-Button-Challenge/).

* **JavaScript Visualization Code (`app.js`):**
This JavaScript file contains the code for the interactive elements on the page. It utilizes *D3* to read in the data and create the visualizations. It also utilizes *Plotly* to create the interactive bar chart and bubble chart. The code is commented to explain the purpose of each section.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: Interactive page with visualizations; the vessel for `app.js`.
- `app.js`: *JavaScript* code containing the core of the visualizations and data pulls (contained in the *static/js* directory).
- `samples.json`: JSON file provided to us to examine the data we're meant to pull from (usage optional as a link to the data was provided as well).

All code written and edited in *Visual Studio Code*, tested with *Chrome* browser.

*Note*: Some of this code was written with the help of fellow classmates for accuracy and efficiency.
